## FAQ

**Q:** Can I fork this app for use in other maid cafes?

**A:** Yes! Please do! If the feature you are adding isn't specific to your particular maid cafe and has the potential to be useful to other maid cafes that are using this app (like my own) please consider making a pull request so that we can all benefit from your contributions ðŸŒ¸


**Q:** I'm a fanimaid volunteer. Can I make contributions to the codebase?

**A:** Unfortunately in the aftermath of fanime this codebase has become incredibly messy again and as such isn't quite ready for contributors yet. That being said, allowing volunteers to pick up issues and make contributions is one of my major goals for the next year, so please keep an eye out for when we are open for contributors!
