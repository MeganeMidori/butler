# Some useful things in case of emergency:

## Clearing a reservation by hand

`reservation = Butler.Repo.get(Butler.Reservation, id)`

`changeset = Butler.Reservation.clearing_changeset(reservation, %{})`

`Butler.Repo.update(changeset)`

## Changing size of a table

`merch = Butler.Repo.get(Butler.Table, <ID>)`

`changeset = Ecto.Changeset.cast(merch, %{max_capacity: 0}, [:max_capacity])`

`Butler.Repo.update(changeset)`
